Gentoo-periodic is a set of system scripts developed to generate reports for the system administrator(s). The idea is based on the 'periodic' systems common on the BSD platforms - but implementation is quite a bit simplified (no common funciton). Standard Output generated by cron running the various other scripts is piped out to a mail command, and from there into the Sysadmin mailbox.
